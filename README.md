# Project Description:
  • A web application simulator, where soon-to-be college students can freely admit themselves into university, 
    with the inclusion of the option to choose what course they want to be in. (The school in the 
    simulator will be the University of the Philippines.) Note: Being that this is a simulator only, 
    the purpose of the actual software is just for user experience, and in no way will the content of 
    this simulator reflect directly into the actual admission process of UP. 

# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) used:
  • Spiral Model consisting of the following:  
  • Planning - so that at least, I have a basis on where to start and what will be the 
               specifications I will include in my software project. 
  • Design - so that it looks visually appealing and not just plain for users. 
  • Coding - for the reason that this project would require it. 
  • Testing - since in any project, this phase is crucial to ensure that the user does 
              not experience any sudden errors while using it.
