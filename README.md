## Quickstart Guide:
1. Copy all the contents from this repository
2. Copy all files and directories in the htdocs directory inside xampp (for example: C:\xampp\htdocs\Enrollment-System), where "Enrollment-System" will contain all of the files.
3. Import the database [portal_college.sql] in phpmyadmin or directly embed it into your MySQL database through the command prompt (refer to this link on how - https://www.warp.dev/terminus/mysql-import-sql-file). 
4. Open your XAMPP Panel and make sure to start your APACHE and MySQL 'Modules' under 'Actions' (refer to this link, if you do not have XAMPP, yet - https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
5. Open any browser, enter localhost, and browse the file location on the search bar. (i.e. localhost/Enrollment-System)

Note:
When logging in as an ADMIN, the login information was set as follows,
- username: admin 
- password: admin123

But, this can be modified within the login_check.php file

## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) used:
- Spiral Model consisting of the following:  
  - Planning - so that at least, I have a basis on where to start and what will be the specifications I will include in my software project. 
  - Design - so that it looks visually appealing and not just plain for users. 
  - Coding - for the reason that this project would require it. 
  - Testing - since in any project, this phase is crucial to ensure that the user does not experience any sudden errors while using it.

- Applicant

## Technology Stack:
- Front-End
  - HTML/CSS
- Back-End
