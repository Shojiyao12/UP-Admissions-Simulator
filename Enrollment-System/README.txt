This is a simple web application using HTML, PHP, and JavaScript along with a MySQL database.

## How to use:
1. Extract the contents of this zip file.
2. Copy all files and directories in the htdocs directory inside xampp (for example: C:\xampp\htdocs\Enrollment-System), where "Enrollment-System" will contain all of the files.
3. Import the database [portal_college.sql] in phpmyadmin or directly embed it into your MySQL database through command prompt (refer to this link on how - https://www.warp.dev/terminus/mysql-import-sql-file). 
4. Open your XAMPP Pannel and make sure to start your APACHE and MySQL 'Modules' under 'Actions' (refer to this link, if you do not have XAMPP, yet - https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html)
5. Open any browser and enter localhost and browse file location on the searchbar. (i.e. localhost/Enrollment-System)
